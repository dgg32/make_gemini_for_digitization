Extract the following details from the invoice text:

Receipt date, Store, Total. And the individual items, icluding their item name, price, and amount

Return the data in JSON format like this:

{

"Receipt date": {"type": "string", "format": "YYYY-MM-DD"},

"Store": {"type": "string"},

"Total": {"type": "number"},

"Items": [

{"Item": {"type": "string"}, "Price": {"type": "number"}, "Amount": {"type": "number"}}

]

}

Be careful, the "Price" here refers to the unit price, not the total price. For example, "農協ミルクモナカ北海道 198 (2個 X 単99)", the price should be 99, not 198. Or from "アカディおなかに 特 ¥438 (2個 X @219)", the price should be 219, not 438.

Also, sometimes there were discounts items (割引), also include these values and make sure they are negative. For example, "割引 40% -144", then "Item" should be "割引", Amount should be 1, and Price should be -144.
